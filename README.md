# u3d_text_3ngine
custom text engine package for per-char coloring and perf improvements

`/Assets/u3d_text_3ngine/` is the folder for creating the asset. Instructions on asset creation TBD.

You will need to import the `TextMesh Pro` asset yourself to get this working. Instructions TBD (need to make a checkin and figure out best steps from clean checkout).
